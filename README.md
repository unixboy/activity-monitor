# Activity Monitor

The idea is simply to monitor content changes on HTTP resources.
If executed as a cronjob it will notify you once changes on a
certain resource occur.


# Usage

Execute 

	git clone https://github.com/cmichi/activity-monitor.git
	cd activity-monitor
	mkdir tmp

Add to your cronjob file:

	*/15 * * * * (cd /path/to/activity-monitor/ && /bin/sh ./15-min.sh)
	0 */12 * * * (cd /path/to/activity-monitor/ && /bin/sh ./12-hrs.sh)
	0 */4 * * * (cd /path/to/activity-monitor/ && /bin/sh ./4-hrs.sh)

You can then go on, adding resources you want to monitor to the files
`15-min.sh`, `12-hrs.sh`, `4-hrs.sh`:
	
	./check-for-changes.sh \
		"alice@mail.de" \
		"http://some-resource.net/index.html" 

Or with preprocessing of content:

	./check-for-changes.sh \
		"alice@mail.de" \
		"http://some-resource.net/index.html" \
		"preprocess/only-body.sh"


# Use Cases

 * Product in Online-Shop is out of stock. Notify me, once it is available again
 * University lecture. Notify me, once new news/exercises/etc. are put on the lecture website
 * Usenet Search. Want to be notified when certain files are available and can be found via a Usenet search site.
 * Event registration. I monitored a Barcamp website to get notified, once the registration was available.
 * Monitor changes on certain Wiki pages.
 * Regularly check if something can be ordered now.
 * Monitor changes to Etherpad.
 * Monitor changes on databases. Some projects offer a HTTP API (e.g.  OpenStreetMap). Regularly exporting the database file and running diffs against it shows changes.
 * Monitor newly created mailinglists at university.


# Not (yet?) support

 * If a login is necessary before a resource can be fetched
